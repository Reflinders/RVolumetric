# RVolumetric
RVolumetric is a module meant to display volumetric lighting for Roblox. It is easy to set up:
```lua
RVolumetric:Set()
```

# Credits
It should be noted that this is built off of filiprodak's open-source module, "BetterGraphics." However, it does improve upon it with several features and much more garbage collecting.
